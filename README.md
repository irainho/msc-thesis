# Linearized General Relativity on hyperboloidal slices — Master thesis by Inês Rainho

This repository was created with the intent of sharing the Mathematica notebooks and code developed during my master's thesis to obtain the degree in Physics Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa.
The goal of the work was to solve the linearized Einstein equations numerically through a hyperboloidal foliation of spacetime.
Details can be found in the main documento (tese_final.pdf), and in the extended abstract (extended_abstract.pdf).

The derivation of the linearized Einstein equations is done in the file FlatLinearizedGR.nb, where it is shown that the equations can be modeled by the GU model.

The regularity conditions at the origin are derived in OriginRegularity3dSphericalPolars.nb, and the regularization at future null infinity is done in reg_scri.nb.
