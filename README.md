# Linearized General Relativity on hyperboloidal slices -- Master thesis by Inês Rainho

This repository was created with the intent of sharing the Mathematica notebooks and code developed during my master's thesis to obtain the degree in Physics Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa.
The goal of the work was to solve the linearized Einstein equations numerically through a hyperboloidal foliation of spacetime.
